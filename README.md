## Try to Rememeber What You Forgot to Remember!

Having trouble keep track of all the millions of things you need to do? Jot them down on this awesome app!

## Challenges

I had all sorts of problems with this challenge, but the main one was that the routes kept breaking. Incorrect file paths and grammar mistakes caused alot of problems as well as countless other things that kept breaking the app. In the end I tried to simplify everything and try doing something that actually worked.

I went through the class module and mini-project carefully and was able to solve most things that were going wrong. I'm glad that they provided code for the front end so I didn't have to worry about it very much.

## Next Steps

Currently we are learning MySQL which seems pretty interesting. I like that alot of the commands seem pretty straight forward and intuitive. I think databases are the last major thing we are learning for the backend part of the bootcamp.
